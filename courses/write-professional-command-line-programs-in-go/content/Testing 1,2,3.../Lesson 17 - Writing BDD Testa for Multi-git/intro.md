In this lesson we will learn how to practice behavior-driven development (BDD) and testing in Go. In particular, we will learn how to use the Ginkgo and Gomega framework to write and run tests. Along the way we will compare BDD-based testing with standard Go testing. We will also implement unit tests for multi-git.
